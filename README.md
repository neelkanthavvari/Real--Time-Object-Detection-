# Real--Time-Object-Detection-
Real time Object Detection  and Tracking using Tensorflow-lite  
1) Developed and deployed a lightweight object detection system, using the MobileNet SSD model (Tensorflow framework and inference engine TFLite ).

2) Performed model hyper tuning and Optimization of the model using full integer quantization to achieve high speed with similar accuracy.

3) Deployed the model in C++ to achieve higher speed and efficiency on edge devices(CCTV cameras with NPU).

4) Deployed a system to perform activity recognition, and find specific objects, in CCTV footage using image embeddings
